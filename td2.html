      <h2 id="analysis">Function Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          These exercises involve plotting and describing the domain and co-domain of more complex functions. There are different ways of approaching this task, and two of such ideas will be explored here: A <b>top-down</b> approach for examples "1d" and "1c" and a <b>bottom-up</b> approach for example "1g".
        </p>

        <h3>Example "1d"</h3>
          <p>
            Initially, the behaviour of the function $f(x) = ln(2x-1)$ is unknown. As a starting point, one can think of $f$ as a composition of $g$ and $z$.

            $$f(x) = g(z(x))$$

            In this case, $g(z) = ln(z)$ is the "top-most" function and wraps everything else, which is neatly "packed" in $z(x) = 2x-1$. For the <b>top-down</b> approach, let's first focus on $g(z) = ln(z)$, whose behaviour is well known.

            <figure>
              <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Log_%282%29.svg" alt="plot of ln(x)">
            </figure>

            It's known that $g(z) = ln(z)$ intersects with the x-axis at $z_0=1$ and that it has a vertical asymptote at $z^*=0$. Because $g(z)$ is the top-most function, these properties will also be reflected by $f(x)$. One just needs to find the respective values of $x_0$ and $x^*$ where they hold true, which can be achieved by solving $z(x)$ for $z_0$ and $z^*$ respectively.

            $$\begin{aligned}
            z(x_0) &= z_0 \\
            2x_0-1 &= 1 \\
            x_0 &= 1 \\
            \\
            z(x^*) &= z^* \\
            2x^*-1 &= 0 \\
            x^* &= \frac{1}{2} \\
            \end{aligned}$$

            Note that these points can also be obtained by considering $z(x)$ as a <a href="https://diegobarmor.github.io/maths-tutorship/cheatsheet.html#manipulations">scaling and shifting</a> operation along the x-axis. This perspective also reveals that $f(x)$ is actually $g(z)$ shrunk by a factor of 2, which wasn't evident before. Knowing this information, one can plot $f(x)$ and find its domain and codomain ($g(z)$ is also shown as reference).

              <img src="figures/td2-1d.png" alt="figures/td2-1d.png">
            </figure>
            $$\begin{aligned}
              x    &\in (\frac{1}{2}, +\infty) \\
              f(x) &\in (-\infty, +\infty) \\
            \end{aligned}$$
          </p>

        <h3>Example "1c"</h3>
          <p>
            Using the top-down approach, the function $f(x) = e^{-|x-1|}$ can be first represented as $f(x) = a(b(x))$ with $a(b)=e^{-b}$. This means that $a(b)$ is just the well-known <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Exp.svg">exponential function</a> <a href="https://diegobarmor.github.io/maths-tutorship/cheatsheet.html#manipulations">inverted</a> along the x-axis.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/td2-1c_0.png" alt="figures/td2-1c_0.png">
            </figure>

            Furthermore, the behaviour of $a(b)$ gets affected by the absolute value found in the next "layer" of composition, i.e. $b(c) = |c(x)|$. The effect of the absolute value can be imagined as a "mirror" placed along the y-axis, essentially "reflecting" the values of $b(c > 0)$ into $b(c < 0)$. This behaviour comes from the fact that $|-c(x)|=|c(x)|=c(x)$ and is further propagated to the plot of $a(b(c))$.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/td2-1c_1.png" alt="figures/td2-1c_1.png">
            </figure>

            Finally, $c(x) = x - 1$ can be considered as a simple shifting operation along the x-axis. This effect is propagated along the chain of function compositions $f(x) = a(b(c(x)))$ by <a href="https://diegobarmor.github.io/maths-tutorship/cheatsheet.html#manipulations">shifting</a> the resulting plot one unit to the right. The final result is the plot for $f(x)$, which also reveals its domain and co-domain.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/td2-1c_2.png" alt="figures/td2-1c_2.png">
            </figure>
            $$\begin{aligned}
              x    &\in (-\infty, +\infty) \\
              f(x) &\in (0,1) \\
            \end{aligned}$$
          </p>

        <h3>Example "1g"</h3>
          <p>
            The top-down approach isn't as intuitive for $f(x) = \sqrt{x^2-5x+6}$, so another strategy can be employed. Again, the function can be represented as a composition $f(x) = g(z(x))$, with $g(z) = \sqrt{z}$ and $z(x) = x^2-5x+6$. This time, $z(x)$ will be analyzed first, hence in a <b>bottom-up</b> fashion. <br>

            The behaviour of $z(x) = x^2-5x+6$ can be observed by plotting it, which shouldn't be problematic. It is convex (i.e. "looks upwards", as $x^2$ has a positive sign) and it can be factorized as $z(x) = (x-2)(x-3)$, which means it intersects the x-axis at $x=2$ and $x=3$.

            <figure>
              <img src="figures/td2-1g_0.png" alt="figures/td2-1g_0.png">
            </figure>

            Furthermore, the shape and behaviour of the function $g(z) = \sqrt{z}$ is well known.

            <figure>
              <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Square_root_0_25.svg" alt="plot of sqrt(x)">
            </figure>

            The idea now is to understand the behaviour of $g(z)$ by exploiting the fact that it's defined in terms of $z$ as its variable. This means that, whenever $z(x)$ grows, $g(z)$ will also grow; note that $g(z)$ "doesn't care" about $x$ in this case. Similarly, whenever $z(x) < 0$, $g(z)$ will be undefined. <br>

            For knowing how to plot $f(x) = g(z)$ at a given point $(x^*,y^*)$, the plot of $z(x) = x^2-5x+6$ becomes handy. One can observe the value at $z^* = z(x^*)$ and use that to know how $y^* = f(z^*)$ should be, following the previous rules. After plotting $f(x)$, the domain and co-domain become once more evident.

            $$\begin{aligned}
              x    &\in (-\infty, 2) \cup (3+\infty) \\
              f(x) &\in (0,+\infty) \\
            \end{aligned}$$
          </p>


      <h2 id="intersections">Intersection of Functions</h2>
        <h3>Example "2a"</h3>
          <p>
            The values of $x$ that comprise the solution for the equation $e^{2x+1}=x-2$ can be inferred by plotting the functions $f(x) = e^{2x+1}$ and $g(x) = x-2$ and finding their point of intersection. After all, when two functions intersect at a given value of $x$, it means that they are equal, which is just a way of rephrasing the original problem. <br>

            In this case, one can see that $f(x) = e^{2x+1}$ is simply the exponential function shrunk by a factor of two and shifted horizontally one unit to the left. On the other hand, $g(x) = x-2$ is a simple line shifted two units down. Just by looking at $f(0)=e$ and $g(0)=-2$ and the general shape of these functions, one can plot them and see that, indeed, they do not intersect i.e. there's no solution for $e^{2x+1}=x-2$.
